# Cancer Prediction Model

This project is a machine learning model built in Python to predict cancer using clinical data from a CSV file (`cancer.csv`). It applies Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier to train on the data and evaluate predictions.

## Technologies Used

Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Dataset

- Input file: `cancer.csv`
- Contains features related to cancer diagnosis along with the target label.
- Make sure the file is in the same directory before running the code.

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:

2. Run the script or notebook:


## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Output

- Accuracy score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Visualizations of data and model evaluation
